1)
You are provided with a number D containing only digits 0's and 1's. Your aim is to convert this number to have all the digits same.
For that, you will change exactly one digit i.e. from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0. If it is possible to make all digits equal (either all 0's or all 1's) by flipping exactly 1 digit then output "YES", else print "NO" (quotes for clarity).

a=input()
z=0;o=0
for i in range(len(a)):
  ch=a[i]
  if(ch=='0'):
    z=z+1
  elif(ch=='1'):
    o=o+1
if((o==1) or (z==1)):
  print('YES',end='')
else:
  print('NO',end='')

2)
Given a list of n-1 numbers ranging from 1 to n, your task is to find the missing number. There are no duplicates. 

n=[int(c) for c in input().split()]
n=sorted(n)
for i in range(1,len(n)+2):
    if i not in n:
        print(i,end='')

3)
Given a list A of elements of length N, ranging from 1 to N. All elements may not be present in the array. If the element is not present then there will be -1 present in the array. Rearrange the array such that A[i] = i and if i is not present display -1 at that place.

a=[int(c) for c in input().split()]
a=sorted(a)
m=[]
for i in range(len(a)):
    if i in a:
        m.append(i)
    else:
        m.append(-1)
for i in m:
    print(i,end=' ')
