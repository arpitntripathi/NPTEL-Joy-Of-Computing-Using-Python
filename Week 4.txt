1)
You are given a number A which contains only digits 0's and 1's. Your task is to make all digits same by just flipping one digit (i.e. 0 to 1 or 1 to 0 ) only. If it is possible to make all the  digits same by just flipping one digit then print 'YES' else print 'NO'.

Input Format:

The first line contains a number made up of 0's and 1's.

Output Format:

Print 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly without quotes.

Example:

Input:

101

Output:
YES

a=input()
z=0;o=0
for i in range(len(a)):
  ch=a[i]
  if(ch=='0'):
    z=z+1
  elif(ch=='1'):
    o=o+1
if((o==1) or (z==1)):
  print('YES',end='')
else:
  print('NO',end='')



2)
Given an integer number n, you have to print the factorial of this number.

a=int(input())
b=1
for i in range(1,a+1):
  b=b*i
print(b,end='')


3)
You are provided with the number of rows (R) and columns (C). Your task is to generate the matrix having R rows and C columns such that all the numbers are in increasing order starting from 1 in row wise manner.

Input Format:
The first line contain two numbers R and C separated by a space.

Output Format:
Print the elements of the matrix with each row in a new line and elements of each row are separated by a space.

NOTE: There should not be any space after the last element of each row and no new line after the last row.

a,b=map(int,input().split())

count=1
m = []
for i in range(1,a+1):
    l = []
    for j in range(1,b+1):
        l.append(count)
        count+=1
    m.append(l)

for i in range(a):
    for j in range(b):
        if(j==b-1):
            print(m[i][j], end="")
        else:
            print(m[i][j], end=" ")
    if(i!=a-1):
        print()
