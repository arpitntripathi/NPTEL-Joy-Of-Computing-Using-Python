1)
Given an array A of N numbers (integers), you have to write a program which prints the sum of the elements of array A with the corresponding elements of the reverse of array A.
If array A has elements [1,2,3], then reverse of the array A will be [3,2,1] and the resultant array should be [4,4,4].

N = int(input())
A = [int(i) for i in input().split(" ")]
B = []
for i in range(len(A)-1, -1,-1):
    B.append(A[i])
C = []
for i in range(len(B)):
    C.append(A[i]+B[i])
for i in range(len(C)):
    if(i==len(C)-1):
        print(C[i])
    else:
        print(C[i],end=" ")



2)
Given a list of numbers (integers), find second maximum and second minimum in this list.

a=[int(c) for c in input().split()]
a.sort()
b,c=a[1],a[-2]
print(c,b)




3)
Given a list A of numbers (integers), you have to print those numbers which are not multiples of 5.

a=[int(c) for c in input().split()]
b=[]
for i in a:
  if(i%5!=0):
    print(i,end=" ")
