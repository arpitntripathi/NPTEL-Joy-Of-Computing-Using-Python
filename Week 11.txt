1)
Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:
Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H]
Following are the fixed values of C and H:
C is 50. H is 30.
D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence.

import math
c=int(50)
h=int(30)
q=[]
d=[int(c) for c in input().split(',')]
for i in range(len(d)):
    a=round(math.sqrt((int(2)*c*d[i])/h))
    q.append(a)
for i in range(len(q)):
    if i==len(q)-1:
        print(q[i],end='')
    else:
        print(q[i],end=',')

2)
Write a program that accepts a comma-separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.

items=[x for x in input().split(',')]
items.sort()
print (','.join(items))

3)
Write a program, which will find all such numbers between m and n (both included) such that each digit of the number is an even number.

Input Format:
The first line contains value m and n separated by a comma.

Output Format:
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Constraints:
1000<=m<=9000
1000<=n<=9000

m,n=input().split(',')
m=int(m)
n=int(n)
l=[]
if m>=1000 and m<=9000:
    if n>=1000 and n<=9000:
        for i in range(m,n+1):
            c=0
            i=str(i)
            for j in range(4):
                if int(i[j])%2==0:
                    c+=1
                    if c==4:
                        l.append(i)
print(",".join(l))
